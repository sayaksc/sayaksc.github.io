    Hello and welcome to my scantily built webpage! I am a junior undergraduate in the department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.
	I am broadly interested in theoretical aspects of Computer Science, mainly Computational Number Theory and Algebra. Currently I am working under  <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/"> Prof Rajat Mittal </a> on Computational Number Theory. In the past, I have also worked on Graphons (Network Statistics), Security in Logic Locking and Cryptography.

<h4> Projects: </h4>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Roots of Polynomials modulo powers of primes </li>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00494"> Graphon Estimation from Partially Observed Network Data </a></li>
<li> <a href="https://sayaksc.github.io/Projects/Logic_Locking.pdf"> Linear Cryptanalysis Applied to Logic Locking</a></li>
<li> Breaking Cryptosystems</li>

<\ul>
